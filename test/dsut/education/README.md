# Education

This folder contains learning materials. The three items are:

 - Intro_DataScience: the materials to go with each individual lesson
 - Explainers: short documents to explain regular concepts we come across in data science
 - Advanced_DataScience: these are more advanced materials that may be presented as brown bags in the future

Please get in touch if you have suggestions about materials you would like covered.

Thank you, [Andy Wheeler, PhD](mailto:andrew.wheeler@hms.com)

ToDo, post advanced data science brownbag recordings.
