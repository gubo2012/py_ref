# Advanced Data Science

We are still in the process of figuring out if we will also have a learning session devoted to more advanced data science materials. (It may make more sense just to put them in specific sections of the DS utilities folder.)

## Potential Lessons

 - Using cost-benefit analysis to set the threshold in predictive models (Done)
 - Setting constraints on how to select cases in predictive models via linear programming (partially done, see `false_pos_constraint.py` currently in the benchmarking folder).
 - Overview of interpretable machine learning summaries (partially done, need to finish example notebook)
 - Conditional Value at Risk to build a less risky portfolio when selecting cases in batch (very preliminary)

For other ideas I would like to pursue eventually:

 - hierarchical models 
 - survival models / discrete time trick with 
 - reinforcement learning strategies (multi-armed bandits)
