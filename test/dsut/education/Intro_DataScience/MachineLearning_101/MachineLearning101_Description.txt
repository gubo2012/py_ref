In Machine Learning 101, we will discuss:

 - The difference between traditional statistical models and contemporary machine learning methods
 - The bias variance tradeoff, and identifying loss functions for predictive models
 - Different types of machine learning models, such as random forests and boosting
 - Provide an example code walkthrough for comparing random forests to logistic regression in python
